# SimplePie 2.0

This is the 2.0 branch of SimplePie. The point of this release is to rip out all of the non-essential crap and focus exclusively on the parser itself.

This is not your mother's SimplePie. We've ripped out fetching, caching and HTML sanitization â€” and that's just to start. You'll need to find other classes to do those things instead.
